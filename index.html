        <p id="imgonnagetcancelled"><strong>Agnes</strong> is the youngest of 6, 4 of which are her late sisters, her elder sister always thought of her as a child, when the family went 
            into financial struggles, <strong>Agnes</strong> got a job as a governess. She started at the Bloomfield family, at the Bloomfield family, she had the vision of good children and gentle parents, 
            however, the parents' attitudes were ice cold. Eventually, the children began misbehaving horribly. Even worse, she couldn't protest about it because she was just a "poor governess".
            she then quit after the children took it too far by killing an animal and laughing with pleasure. A few months later, she went into a new family, the
            "Murray" family. She met <strong>Rosalia</strong>, and <strong>Matilda</strong>, <strong>Matilda</strong> is a tomboy, and <strong>Rosalia</strong> is a flirt. Both girls are selfish and sometimes unpleasant, although <strong>Agnes's</strong> position is slightly better than at Bloomfield's, she is still usually ignored
            or used by the girls.
            <strong>Agnes</strong> begins to visit Nancy Brown, an old woman with poor eyesight who needs help reading the bible, <strong>Agnes</strong> then meets the new curate, Mr. Edward Weston. 
            On the next day while on a walk Agnes is surprised by <strong>Mr. Weston</strong>, who picks up some roses for her, she saves it as a moment of her friendship and her first sign of love emerging.
            A few months later, on a walk, Agnes spots <strong>Rosalia</strong> with Mr.Hatfield, trying to be a gentlemen, she flirts with him, and the man falls in love with her, only for him to have his heart shattered by her cold rejection.
            Then, out of pure disrespect and greed, with previous warnings from Agnes about Sir Thomas Ashby, a wealthy man who owns Ashby Park, she marries him.
            <strong>Agnes</strong> then recieves a letter that her dad is dying, she mourns him, but is too late as he has already died.
            <strong>Agnes</strong> then gets a letter from Lady Ashby, AKA: <strong>Rosalia</strong>, that she is unhappy, she comforts her before walking on the beach, she finds <strong>Mr. Weston</strong>, and she gets proposed to,
            <strong>Agnes</strong> happily accepts, and they become married.

        </p>
        <h1>Quick Explanation of the plot themes.</h1>
        <p>Most of the story revolves around <strong>Agnes'</strong> anxiousness, usually, around lower class people, she acts a lot more confident and calm, but around higher class people, she is stuttering and nervous at first. This shows a strong indication that the book is centered around the theme of Social Class.</p>
